          <h2>Meet Me App</h2>
            <p>
              Meet Me App was created to allow users to view different Front-End developer events that take place all around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              The app was developed with the following five features in mind:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Filter by events</li>
              <li>Show and hide event details</li>
              <li>Specify the number of events</li>
              <li>Use the app when offline</li>
              <li>View a chart to see the number of upcoming events by city</li>
            </ul>

          <h2>Movie App</h2>
          <p>
            Moovies was created to encourage and inspire children to learn more about the films they are watching. Users have the opportunity to access information about a range of different movies (including title and description), genres (including genre name and description)and directors (including name, bio and birth year). The information that is displayed when the user clicks on the movie card, is fetched from an external API.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role in this was the developer and throughout the achievement I learnt many valuable lessons. One task that I learnt a lot from and found particularly challenging was creating the user profile. Initially the challenging part was understanding the components and their function and purpose in the code. Furthermore, the profile also had many requirements and pulling these requirements into smaller pieces, and collaborating with my peers/mentor helped me to become successful in achieving the task.

          <h2>Pokédex</h2>
          <p>
            Pokédex, a small web application, was created for users to learn about various Pokémons. Upon clicking on an individual Pokémon button, a modal appears which enables the user to view the specific attributes (weight, height and two images) related to that Pokémon. It information about each Pokémon is loaded from an external API.
         </p>
          <p> 
            In this project, I learnt many new concepts such as how to implement a UI pattern, using Javascript and how to load data from an external API. A task that I found quite challenging was implementing the modal. This was challenging because I did not understand how to open and close the modal however, once I understood the function, I was able to implement it.
